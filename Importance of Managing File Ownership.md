managing file ownership is important for security, accountability, collaboration, file organization, and administrative control. It helps protect sensitive data, establish responsibility, enable teamwork, organize files, and maintain the overall integrity of a system.

What is the command to view file ownership?

ls -l
Output is:
-rw-r--r--  1 john  staff    548 Jun 15 09:32 example.txt
drwxr-xr-x  2 jane  users   4096 Jun 17 14:18 my_folder


What permissions are set when a user creates a file or directory? Who does file or directory belong to?

Permissions:

For a new file: The default permissions for a newly created file are typically set to 666 (-rw-rw-rw-). This means that the owner, group, and others have read and write permissions.

For a new directory: The default permissions for a newly created directory are typically set to 777 (drwxrwxrwx). This means that the owner, group, and others have read, write, and execute permissions.
Ownership:

The file or directory initially belongs to the user who created it. The user is set as the owner, and the primary group associated with the user is set as the group owner.

The user and group ownership can be changed using commands like chown and chgrp.

Why does the owner, by default, not receive X permissions when they create a file?

The rationale behind not granting all permissions to the owner by default is rooted in security considerations and the principle of least privilege. By only granting the necessary permissions initially, the system reduces the risk of accidental or malicious modification or execution of files. It encourages the owner to explicitly specify the desired permissions for the file based on their intended use.

What command is used to change the owner of a file or directory?

Linux and macOS (Unix-based systems):
The command is chown. Here's the basic syntax:
chown new_owner file_or_directory

For example, to change the owner of a file named "example.txt" to a user named "newuser" in Linux or macOS, you would run:  chown newuser example.txt
