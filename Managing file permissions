Does being the owner of a file mean you have full permissions on that file? Explain.

When you create a file, you are usually assigned as the owner of that file by default. As the owner, you typically have the following privileges:

Read: You can view the contents of the file.
Write: You can modify or delete the file, including appending or overwriting its contents.
Execute: If the file is executable (such as a program or script), you can run it.

However, there are cases where the owner may not have full permissions on the file. Additional factors can influence file permissions, such as:

Group permissions: Files can be associated with specific groups, and the permissions assigned to the group can affect what the owner can do. If the file belongs to a group, the owner's permissions may be restricted by the group's permissions.

Other users' permissions: The file system may have permissions defined for users who are not the owner or part of the associated group. These permissions can further restrict the owner's capabilities on the file.

Access control lists (ACLs): Some file systems support ACLs, which provide more granular control over file permissions. ACLs allow for customizing permissions for specific users or groups beyond the basic owner and group permissions.


If you give permissions to the User entity, what does this mean?

By assigning permissions to the User entity, you are determining what actions or operations the user can perform and what resources they can access. These permissions define the level of control and functionality the user has within the system.

Some common types of permissions that can be assigned to a User entity include:

Read: Allows the user to view or read specific information or resources.

Write: Enables the user to create or modify data or resources.

Execute: Grants the user permission to run or execute certain processes or operations.

Delete: Gives the user the ability to remove or delete specific data or resources.

Administer: Provides administrative privileges, allowing the user to manage system settings, user accounts, or access control.


If you give permissions to the Group entity, what does this mean?

When you give permissions to the "Group" entity, it typically refers to granting specific privileges or access rights to a group of users collectively. A "Group" is an entity that represents a collection of users or entities within a system or organization. By assigning permissions to a Group, you effectively extend those permissions to all members of that Group.


If you give permissions to the Other entity, what does this mean?

The term "Other" is often used to encompass individuals, entities, or groups that are not explicitly identified or included in predefined categories.

Granting permissions to the "Other" entity generally means allowing access or authorization to perform certain actions or access specific resources within a system. The exact scope and extent of these permissions would depend on the specific context and the system in question. It could involve granting read or write access to certain files or folders, allowing execution of specific programs or commands, or providing access to certain functionalities within a software application.


You give the following permissions to a file: User permissions are read-only, Group permissions are read and write, Other permissions are read, write and execute. You are logged in as the user which is owner of the file. What permissions will you have on this file? Explain.

User is root user.

r--rw-rwx       permission granted are 467
You as owner can only read/view the file, not add/modify the file and run or execute any processes or operations.
